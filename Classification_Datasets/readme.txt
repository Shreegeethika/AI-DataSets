Inside every dataset folder, there will be several CSV files with different names.

While working with Classification dataset, you need to upload any of the CSV file provided.

There will be one file with simple/default name or OG written in the name. That file is the original dataset. Other files are derived from it.
The files with names like 80missing or 40missinng contains reduced datapoints from the original dataset.
The files with names like 3attributesmissing or 3columnmissing contain reduced columns from the original dataset. (Column selection can also be done from software using OG dataset.)
Both of these dataset variants can be used for checking the effect on accuracy.

There is one Excel file named as output.
While prediction, you can type input values mentioned there and verify your prediction. You can also enter your own values by searching on the INTERNET.

Thanks.
